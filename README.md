# Wagtail Tutorial

## Getting Started With Wagtail

I am learning how to use Wagtail. I followed the first tutorial to build a blog.

I followed the tutorial as per instructions and only made small additions to the blog page and the blog post details page.

The site is hosted with fly.io

As this is the first ever wagtail site that I have built I will leave it exactly as it is without doing anything else.
