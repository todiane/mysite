# Wagtail Tutorial

## Getting Started With Wagtail

I am learning how to use Wagtail. I followed the first tutorial to build a blog.

I followed the tutorial as per instructions and only added a little django code to the blog page and the blog post details page to change their look.

As this is the first ever wagtail site that I have built I will leave it exactly as it is without doing anything else.
